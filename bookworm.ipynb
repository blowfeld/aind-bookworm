    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

    "## 3. Parse natural language questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand questions posed in natural language, we'll use another Watson service called [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.html). It can be used to design conversational agents or _chatbots_ that exhibit complex behavior, but for the purpose of this project, we'll only use it to parse certain kinds of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Conversation service instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you did for the Discovery service, create an instance of the Conversation service. Then launch the associated tool from the service dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-tooling.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Tool homepage\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A _workspace_ allows you to keep all the items you need for a particular application in one place, just like an _environment_ in case of the Discovery service. Create one called \"Bookworm\" with a suitable description, such as \"I know a lot of stories. Ask me a question!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-workspace.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Blank workspace\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This should open up a blank workspace, where you can add intents, define the entities you want the agent to idenitfy and structure the overall dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add intents\n",
    "\n",
    "An _intent_ is the goal or purpose of a user's input. Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could enter the following examples for the _where_ intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where is the Jedi temple located?\n",
    "- Where was Luke born?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversation service recommends at least 5 examples for each intent so that Watson learns how to recognize it. These don't have to be very precise, but more examples the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-intents.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Intents listed\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to create your own intents, based on the kinds of questions you want the system to answer, e.g. \"How many ...\", \"What are the most common ...\" etc. Each intent will need to be mapped to an appropriate query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [**Defining intents**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/intents.html) for a helpful video and further instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What intents did you add to the Conversation service instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "* `#who`: Ask for a subject\n",
    "* `#what`: Ask for an object\n",
    "* `#relation`: Ask for relations between persons\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Pick one of these intents, and list at least 5 examples for the intent that you entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: `#relation`:\n",
    "* Is Vader Luke's father?\n",
    "* Did Padmé give birth to Luke and Leia?\n",
    "* Is Obi-Wad Boba's sister?\n",
    "* Is Luke the son of Vader?\n",
    "* Do Chewbacca and Lando have the same mother?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your intents set, let's tell the service what entities we want it to identify. One way to do this is using the tool interface, and entering them one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Go to [**Defining entities**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/entities.html) to see how that is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that can be tedious! So let's refer back to the entities that the Discovery service identified, and load them in programmatically.\n",

    "**Q**: Now that you have gone through this exercise of designing a system that uses two IBM Watson services, what did you learn? What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "We learned how to setup a collection of text documents (in the discovery service) that is analysed and enriched with semantic information that can be used to query/extract information from those documents. In addition we did setup a conversation service that allows to parse incoming text and trigger certain actions if a semantic condition is met. The semantic information about the triggered condition can then be used to query the discovery service for answers/information that can be returned as response to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of the system is that it can react not only to input in a predefined syntactic structure, but can process the meaning/semantics of less stuctured input (i.e. natural language). For the converstation use case this works pretty good for well defined and not too ambiguous problem settings, but can become quite tedious for more complex scenarios. In that cases a good definiton of entities and well designed error handling could help to avoid ambiguities in the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Optional) Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a set of sample data files containing Star Wars plot summaries. But as mentioned before, you are free to use your own dataset. In fact, a larger dataset maybe more suitable for use with IBM Watson's NLP services. If you used your own dataset, answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What dataset did you use, and in what ways is it different from the sample files provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Either include your dataset in the .zip file or repository you submit, or provide clear instructions on how to obtain the dataset, so that your reviewer can run your notebook or inspect the data to verify your results.\n",
